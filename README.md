# SpeedTestS

Color internet speed test for any device: 
win, posix.

Arbitrarily simple interface, clear, the color
of the text will depend on your speed.

The code includes all possible errors in the work.

We run main.py - Y - 5, get the speed from 
each test, and then the average connection speed.
